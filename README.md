## Future (Over the Summer):
* Add Readme to all homeworks/projects
* Make videos for each project to add to the Readme
* Look at other people's Readme + Readme of massive open-source projects
    * Learn about good Readme style and techniques
    * Learn about giving instructions to users on how they can run my code
